### Architect of Data, Code, and Chaos (in the best way)

I’m Krish, a software engineer on a mission to bring order to the wild world of data. With a specialization in crafting large-scale, hyper-concurrent distributed systems, I design solutions that don’t just handle data—they orchestrate it. My expertise lies in building the infrastructure that supports data-intensive backends, turning the heavy lifting of database architecture and performance optimization into a seamless experience for applications (and the people who depend on them).

Whether it’s streaming real-time events with millisecond precision or optimizing batch processing to shave off those extra cycles, I create scalable backends that are resilient, responsive, and ready for anything. I like to think of myself as part architect, part problem-solver, and full-time advocate for engineering that makes life easier, faster, and more efficient.

If you're interested in data pipelines that move like clockwork or distributed systems that practically run themselves, let’s connect. I love making the complex simple—and maybe a bit more fun. Hmu at krishparadox@gmail.com
